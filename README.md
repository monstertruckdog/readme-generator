# Professional README Generator

### Description

To help reduce the time and effort it takes for a develper to organize and properly format information about their application's README file, we have created a README generator.  This application, written in node.js, will prompt the developer to enter the necessary information about their application or project and create a professional README document for them.  

### Installation

Installation consists of simply having a couple of Javascript files, downloading a package from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and running the `node` command on  one of those JS files:

1. [Clone or fork the repository](https://github.com/monstertruckdog/readme-generator) to a local directory
2. In your terminal, navigate to the directory and execute the following command:

 ```
 npm i inquirer
 ```
3. Once installation is completed, execute another command in the terminal:

 ```
  node index.js
```

### Usage

##### Entering README text

![entering-readme-text](./utils/readme_content/enteringreadmetext.mov)

##### Finished Product

![finshed-readme-product](./utils/readme_content/finalreadme.mov)
