## Description

To help reduce the time and effort it takes for a develper to organize and properly format information about their application's README file, we have created a README generator.  This application, written in node.js, will prompt the developer to enter the necessary information about their application or project and create a professional README document for them.  

## Installation

1. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/monstertruckdog/readme-generator) to a local directory
2. In your terminal, navigate to the repository directory and execute the following command:

 ```
 npm i
 ```
3. Once installation is completed, execute another command in the terminal:

 ```
  node index.js
```

4. Follow the prompts in the application
5. Once the application has generated the file navigate to the `/output` folder in the directory
6. Open the `README.md` file and make any edits needed
7. When ready, add the `README.md` file to the repo directory so that it's ready for the next `git add`

## Usage

##### Entering README text
